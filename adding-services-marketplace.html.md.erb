This topic describes how to use Apps Manager to
add and bind service instances through the Marketplace.
The Marketplace provides users with self-service, on-demand
provisioning of add-on services.

For more information about how to add Managed Services to your Cloud Foundry deployment, refer to the [Services](../services/index.html) topics.

To use a service with your application, you must access the Services
Marketplace, create and configure an instance of the service, then bind the
service instance to your application.

Follow the steps below to access the Marketplace.

1. Log in to Apps Manager for your Cloud Foundry deployment.

1. In the left navigation panel, click **Marketplace**.

    * **Instance Name**: Create a name for this instance of the service.
	Service instance names must be unique within a space.

	to add the service instance.

	to the app.
